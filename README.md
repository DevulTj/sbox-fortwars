fortwars for sandbox

capture the flag battle between two teams, build up your fort in the build round and cap the flags in the combat round.

basic todo:

* [ ] SetMaterial based on Player team (waiting for API binding)
* [ ] Proper weapons (can just copy from dm98)
* [ ] UI: React to RPCs to show frags, captures.
* [ ] UI: Ammo count, weapon select, etc..
* [ ] Balance teams properly
* [ ] Display flag properly, waiting for some form of clientside transformations of entities in IFrameUpdate.
* [ ] Win state
* [ ] Cleanup code, just learning how the API works after all

far future todo:

* [ ] Different gamemodes to CTF
