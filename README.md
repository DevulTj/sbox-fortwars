# FortWars for s&box
 
This is a continuation of [matt's FortWars gamemode](https://github.com/themasterminds/sbox-fortwars) with updates for API changes as well as tweaks and improvements to gameplay.

## What is FortWars?

Capture the flag battle between two teams, build up your fort in the build round and cap the flags in the combat round.

## TODO

* [X] Display flag properly, waiting for some form of clientside transformations of entities in IFrameUpdate.
* [ ] SetMaterial based on Player team (waiting for API binding)
* [ ] Proper weapons (can just copy from dm98)
* [ ] UI: React to RPCs to show frags, captures.
* [ ] UI: Ammo count, weapon select, etc..
* [ ] Balance teams properly
* [ ] Win state
* [ ] Cleanup code, just learning how the API works after all

Far future:

* [ ] Different gamemodes to CTF
